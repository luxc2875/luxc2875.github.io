I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Mark Gross](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~mg475/).
I am interested in the connections between
(logarithmic) enumerative geometry and mirror symmetry.

Before coming to Cambridge, I completed my undergraduates and integrated masters
at the University of Warwick.
