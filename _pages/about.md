I am a second year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Mark Gross](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~mg475/).

My interests lie in the connections between
(logarithmic) enumerative geometry and mirror symmetry.
I am currently thinking about
positive genus punctured Gromov--Witten invariants and how they relate to
higher double ramification cycles.
More recently, I am starting to get interested in
how scattering diagrams arise in the contexts of both
Donaldson--Thomas theory and the Gross--Siebert programme.

Before coming to Cambridge, I completed my undergraduates and integrated masters
at the University of Warwick.
My MMath research project was supervised by
[Diane Maclagan](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/D.Maclagan/).
